# 🧪 InfraEcho

**InfraEcho** is a deployable platform framework designed to simulate real-world customer environments for testing, demos, and troubleshooting. It enables isolated, reproducible environments that mirror production setups, complete with third-party software, CI/CD integration, and full Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) support.

Ideal for pre-deployment validation and training scenarios, InfraEcho ensures parity between lab and live systems.
